In this article I want to explain fundamentals of Roslyn architecture. Less talking about packages and coding.

Two level of access:

<ul>
<li>Synctatical - has limitation to kind of information which can be explored.. Can find any element but cannot search in references</li> 
<li>Semantic - can search also on synctatical level. Quering semantic model is typically more expensive than quering syntax tree.</li>
</ul>

Syntax tree components:

<ul>
    <li>SyntaxNode - declarations, statements, clauses, and expressions. Its wrapper around token. Always have SyntaxTokens</li>
    <li>SyntaxToken - terminals of language grammar, representing smallest syntactic fragments. Cannot be broken into simpler pieces.</li>
    <li>Trivia</li>
</ul>

LINQ approach is useful when is needed specific pieces of syntax. But sometimes we need process all nodes - SyntaxWalker is solution.

If is needed change SyntaxTree in some way, there is class CSharpSyntaxWalker.

As with SyntaxWalker, there is simple state of returned value:

<ul>
    <li>The original, unchanged node, token or trivia.</li>
    <li>Null, signalling the node, token or trivia is to be removed.</li>
    <li>A new syntax node, token or trivia.</li>
</ul>

Workspaces our our root mode. Unlike solutions, they wont become invalid and always contains reference to current most up-to-date solutions.

There are 5 Workspace variants to consider:

<ul>
<li>Workspace - meant to be agnostic as to the physical source of files it represents.</li>
<li>MSBuildWorkspace - actually is no way to write no csproj or sln. </li>
<li>AdHocWorkspace - </li>
<li>VisualStudioWorkspace - consumed within VS packages. Tighly integrated with VS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Semantic model</h2>

Bridge between world of syntax and world of symbol:

There are three ways to request semantic model:

1. Document.GetSemanticModel()
2. Compilation.GetSemanticModel(SyntaxTree)
3. Various Diagnostic AnalysisContexts including CodeBlockStartAnalysisContext.SemanticModeland SemanticModelAnalysisContext.SemanticModel

Symbols - uniquer elements names - types, methods, properties and go on


SemanticModel.GetDeclaredSymbol() accepts declaration syntax and provides the corresponding symbol.
SemanticModel.GetSymbolInfo() accepts expression syntax  (eg. InvocationExpressionSyntax) and returns a symbol.

Its effecitent create only one SemanticModel because caches local symbol and semantic information. 

<h2>Data flow analysis</h2>

AnalyzeControlFlow and AnalyzeDataFlow make frustrated.

<h3>Data flow analysis</h3>

This API can be used to inspect how variables are read and writtern within a given block of code.

Data flow analysis can be used to find the statements and rewriter to log them. In <a href="https://joshvarty.com/2015/02/05/learn-roslyn-now-part-8-data-flow-analysis/">Learn Roslyn Now</a> is used for analyze for written/readed within inner and outer of for statements. Method AnalyzeDataFlow is located in abstract SemanticModel class.

Then exists also Control flow analysis. Is used to understand various entry and exit points within block of code. In method is interesting return points, in for-loop break or continue etc.

1 - Trying create analyzer from default template.
2 - Code fix provider.
